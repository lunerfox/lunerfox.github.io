## Michelle
The book you are holding recounts the tale of Leo and Michelle as they sought for the
true essence of the Honey Moon; An ancient seer known as Wiki of Pedia had informed them that since the 5th century, newly wed couples would drink a sweet beverage on the first moon.

Upon hearing of this quest, the couple left for the United Kingdom, where they search Taverns for such drink. Having consumed this intoxicating substance, the couple found themselves in front of the royal palace, where they were quickly turned away by the royal guard.

Fleeing in the night, the couple boarded the next airship to a sandy land known as Marrakesh. From there, they traveled through the desert, riding on strange beasts as they climbed endless dunes and slept under the stars. When no one was looking, Leo stole some of the magical red sand for his collection.

## Leo
Having safely crossed the desert, the pair was stronger then ever, and *hungrier* then ever, as well. Luckily, they ended up at the city of Lyon, where they feasted on wine and cheese to celebrate their excellent journey.
