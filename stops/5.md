## Leo
> You are now at the living room. This is where Leo and Michelle would hang out after work, asking each other about how their day went, or watching a video from the projector. They would also use this space to entertain guests, and would often be having conversation while making food in the kitchen.

## Michelle
>The living room is also where they display their prized possessions.
One of Leo's most prized artifacts is the signed Hardhat, which bears the signatures of all the people he built Shanghai Disneyland with. He is also fond of the postcards featured above, which provides a glimpse into the life of Chinese citizens during the cultural revolution through propaganda posters.
