## Michelle
> This 0.1378 Acre Burbank Estate is a modern, state-of-the-art reimagining of a
classic, 1940s Craftsman home. Featuring open spaces and wide areas, the home
integrates the living space seamlessly across the front and back of the house.

## Leo
> With 1300 square foot of indoor space, the home features recessed lighting,
as well as doors, windows, a floor, and roof. Guests can be sheltered from the
relative hazards of the outside, with lumber and high-grade pressed gypsum plaster,
acting as fully enclosing, horizontal barriers.

>In addition to the living area, the house also contains a kitchen, an office, a
master's bedroom, and a guest bedroom for hosting friends and family.
