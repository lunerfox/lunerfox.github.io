## Michael
> The office is where Leo would spend his time working on his various projects,
or immerse himself in various games, a hobby he has grown up with for as long as
he could remember. Listen to his recollection on this:

## Leo
*Talks about his early memories of gaming*
> My parents were gamers - My early memories was watching my parents play Galega on their NES.
> To me, games represented a very happy, carefree time in my life.

## Michael
> Leo's love for games is well known to all his friends. Teresa, a long
time friend of the couple, gifted them a portrait of themselves in the world
of Portal, a popular action puzzle game about the cost of "Doing Science".
