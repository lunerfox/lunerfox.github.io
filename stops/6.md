## Michael
> The office is where Leo would spend his time working on his various projects,
or immerse himself in various games, a hobby he has grown up with for as long as
he could remember. Listen to his recollection on this:

## Leo
*Talks about his early memories of gaming*
> My parents were gamers - My early memories was watching my parents play Galega on their NES.
> To me, games represented a very happy, carefree time in my life.

## Michael
> Leo's love for games is well known to all his friends. Teresa, a long
time friend of the couple, gifted them a portrait of themselves in the world
of Portal, a popular action puzzle game about the cost of "Doing Science".

## Michelle
> A recent passion for Leo has been all about Virtual Reality. After leaving
Disney, he formed a company with Michael to explore this new medium. If you
are interested, please check out the interactive VR exhibit in the Garage.
