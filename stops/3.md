This section has been narrated by Michael Sechooler.

## Michael

> Leo and Michelle first met during their formative years, at the Westmoor High College Preparatory School for regular children.

> Michelle's best friend, Zorine, had this to say about their relationship.

## Zorine

*Zorine describes what it was like when we first started dating, from her perspective*

## Michael

>The two would later go to community college together, then a long, 3.5 year long distance relationship as Michelle attended UC Davis, and Leo attended UCLA.

>After Leo graduated from UCLA, he obtained his first full time position at Walt Disney Imagineering. Michelle was asked to move to Los Angeles; Leo was so appreciative of her sacrifice, that he learned how to play guitar to form a special night on her arrival. Check out the guitar in the living room if you'd like to learn more.

>Not long after, the couple were married, and the Disney Company sent the two to Shanghai. The pictures you are seeing in this book details their adventures in China, Japan, and California. One of Leo's most prized artifacts is the signed Hardhat, which bears the signatures of all the people he built Shanghai Disneyland with.
