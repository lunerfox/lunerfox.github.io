## Leo
> This is where Leo, Michelle, and Cara the Chiweenie sleeps.
The Master Bedroom. Featuring a king size bed where the couple can sleep without touching each other, this bed has been with the couple since Shanghai (Leo: Featuring a king size bed, the couple enjoys making starfish. This king size bed originated in China where they got it from relocation. It was so comfortable that they decided to bring it back home ). Since the bed is so comfortable to lay down on, the couple have a hard time getting up and turning off the lights. This inspired them to get smart switches so that they can turn off all the lights with a push of a button on their phone or voice activate via alexa.
And we can go back to a normal transcript.

Cara enjoys sleeping underneath the bed where its nice and cold during hot days. She also uses this location as a hiding spot when Michelle calls her out for baths. Overall the family converge here during night time to sleep.
