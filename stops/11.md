## Leo
> On hot summer days, you'll often find Leo and Michelle relaxing under the Patio,
enjoying the outdoor breeze. In the yard, Citrus trees line the picket fence.

> Michelle plans to use this space as her personal garden, as she renovates the
grassy area to pursue her passions for growing vegetables, herbs, and raising her
very own apiary.

### Conclusion
This is the last stop of the audio guide. We hope you've enjoyed it!
