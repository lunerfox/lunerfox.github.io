## Leo
> This is where Leo, Michelle, and Cara the Chiweenie sleeps. The main feature of the Master Bedroom is of course, the bed. As it turns out, this bed has a story of its own. When the couple moved to Shanghai, they received a bed as part of the package. It was so comfortable that when it came time to return home, they decided to bring it all the way back to the US.

## Michelle
> Although Cara is not usually allowed on the bed, she enjoys sleeping underneath, where its nice and cold during hot days. She also uses this location as a hiding spot when it's time for a bath.
