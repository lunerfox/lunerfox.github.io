## Leo

> One of Leo and Michelle's
The Kitchen
The couple would say that the kitchen is the heart of home. Many meals are made and shared among friends here.
Preparing meals in this kitchen is such a treat with gas stove convection oven. Michelle can make Rib eye steak
with nice crust on the meat and prepare it medium rare in minutes. To go along with the steak, she also make a friends favorite
coffee creme brulee. Even her friend that is not excited about food changes is excited about this creme brulee (Maybe add something about Michael here)
