## Leo
> The guest room is where Leo and Michelle would host their friends and family
when they visit. One of Michelle's favorite memories is featured here, when
she toured Europe with her friends, Zorine, Tina, and Jasmine. She collected postcards from thr various landmarks, which created the collage shown here.
