## Leo

> If you asked Michelle, she would tell you that the Kitchen is the heart of this home. Indeed, many meals  and memories have been made and shared among friends here.

> In many ways, this modern kitchen is the crown jewel of the home. Featuring a gas stove and convection oven, Michelle is able to make a variety of dishes such as steaks and desserts with ease. Her speciality,
espresso creme brulee, is a perennial favorite, even among our pickiest of friends. Listen to her recollection here:

## Michelle

> Micheal is not a person that gets excited about food. In fact, he couldn't eat most of the desserts I make, because of his peanut allergy. Imagine my surprise when Michael is asking for seconds on the Espresso Creme Brulee I made; That moment was when I felt the most validation in my life as a chef.
