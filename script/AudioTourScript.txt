#Honey Moon
Leo and Michelle has obtained a quest to travel outside the country to capture the essence of honey in the moon.
The quest seems to have originated back to 5th century where newly wed couples drank mead during the first moon of marriage.
Finding that meads can be found in United Kingdom, the couple travel to London where they found Tavern that serves mead.
Consuming this mead the couple find themselves in the drunken state and attempted to visit the royal highness to be more
enlighten about their new matrimony. However, they were quickly turned away by the royal guard. Saddened by the turn of events
the couple went to borough market where they  fill their empty stomachs with delicacy. Having satisfied their stomachs they've
encountered a merchant that talked about recent married couples that travelled through the dessert of Sahara to fulfill
the quest of Honey Moon. Inspired by the idea, the couple travel through Marrakesh in Morocco where they meet a Berber
who is knowledgeable of the land.  He has given the couple the tour of the place and taking them safely to the Sahara
by riding a dromedary. Sitting in the orange red powdered sand the couple gazed at the stars and found the essence of honey
in the moon. Having found the essence they decided to travel to Lyon France, the world's gastronomical city in the world
to celebrate. The End.
